<H3>About <em>jsotp</em></H3>

<em>jsotp</em> is a JavaScript implementation of a one-time password
generator/calculator for the OTP and S/Key systems. It supports MD4, MD5, and
SHA-1 hashing methods, by way of <A
HREF="http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/">code</A> written by Paul Johnston. It
also supports RIPEMD-160, through some <A
HREF="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jjlin/jsotp/src/hash/rmd160.js">code</A>
that I wrote. This calculator was inspired by Harry Mantakos's Java applet
OTP calculator (available <A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~harry/jotp/">at his
site</A>). If there's already a Java applet version, then why a JavaScript
version? Because in regard to web browsers, JavaScript is still by far the
most universally available programming language (I was actually very
surprised that I couldn't find an existing JavaScript-based
calculator).

Also, I've added some enhancements that make <em>jsotp</em> basically the
only thing you need for generating OTP and S/Key passwords: it runs in most
semi-modern web browsers, can generate passwords for all of the hash methods
commonly supported, and can generate single passwords, as well as lists of
passwords suitable for printing. Another benefit is that if you're using
<em>jsotp</em> remotely, it's relatively easy for you to verify that the copy
you're using doesn't do anything funny, since you can easily view the source
from within your browser.

<p>

If you're so inclined, <em>jsotp</em> can also be used as a divination tool.
Just type in your question as the seed, enter your current favorite
not-too-big number, and flail on the keyboard for a bit. Finally, pick your
lucky hashing method to see what fate has in store for you today.  It usually
doesn't make much sense, but then again, what in life does?

<p>

Feel free to examine the source and host a copy of your own for better
security. If you intend for other people also to use your copy, however,
please at least retain a link back to the <em>jsotp</em> site.

<H3>What are OTP and S/Key, and why use them?</H3>

OTP and S/Key are one-time password systems. Unsurprisingly, OTP also stands
for "one-time password". In these systems, you generate a sequence of hashes
by repeatedly applying a secure one-way hash on a random seed value prepended
to your secret passphrase. Then you can use the hashes as one-time passwords,
in backwards order; since the hashes are one-way, knowing a hash later in the
sequence will not help you compute an earlier hash in a reasonable amount of
time. Note that since the hashes are just random-looking 64-bit numbers, they
are usually converted to a six-word format to make it easier for the user to
keep track of what he's typing. Also, while OTP generators are required to
show the words in all uppercase, the server should not care what case they
are in, so feel free to type an OTP in all lowercase.

<P>

OTP is basically a somewhat updated (and mostly compatible) version of the
S/Key system created at Bellcore (which also owns the trademark on the name
S/Key). OTP is described in <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2289.txt">RFC
2289</A>, and S/Key is described in <A
HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1760.txt">RFC 1760</A>. You can also find
some additional documents related to OTP authentication <A
HREF="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/otp-charter.html">here</A>. OTP and
S/Key have generally not been all that useful since the advent of SSH, but I
think they remain useful in two situations:

<UL>

<LI>You want to log into a remote system from a computer that has neither a
native SSH client nor a browser that supports running a Java applet SSH
client (either because Java isn't installed, or the version is too old), or
the connection is slow and you just don't feel like downloading a large
applet. In this case, as long as you do have a telnet client (which comes
with most operating systems), an OTP system can be a good alternative.

<LI>You want to log into a remote system from another computer, but you
suspect (or are just paranoid) that this computer may log keystrokes or
something. Having an SSH client available obviously doesn't help with this
problem, but having a precomputed list of one-time passwords does (though
having such a list ready when you need it does require a little advance
planning). You can use <em>jsotp</em> to generate however many passwords you
think you might need (make sure you do it from a trusted computer!), then
print them out and keep them safely with you.

<P>

OTP's can be used fruitfully with other network services (such as email, FTP,
etc.), assuming the particular daemon you're using can be configured to
accept OTP's. For example, if the SSH daemon on the remote end is configured
to accept OTP's, then you can use an OTP in conjunction with SSH to gain
end-to-end encryption. However, if you think keystrokes are being logged,
then it's not such a stretch to think that the local SSH client may be
capturing incoming data too, so it's still risky to type or display anything
sensitive. Also, there are more nefarious, active attacks that OTP's would
not provide any protection against; for example, the local SSH client could
conceivably be trojaned to allow an attacker to send commands of his choice
to the system you've logged into.

<H3>The source</H3>

<em>jsotp</em> is normally stripped of comments and whatnot to make it a tiny
bit faster to download. There are also versions that include only one
particular hashing method (<A
HREF="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jjlin/jsotp/md4/">MD4</A>, <A
HREF="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jjlin/jsotp/md5/">MD5</A>, <A
HREF="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jjlin/jsotp/sha1/">SHA-1</A>, <A
HREF="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jjlin/jsotp/rmd160/">RIPEMD-160</A>)
that provide a more noticeable decrease in page size (these contain all code
inline, so you can just save the page without copying any other source
files). And while it's not all that interesting, you can find the version
with comments retained as
<b>otp.js</b> in <A HREF="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jjlin/jsotp/src/">this
directory</A>.

<H3>License</H3>

<em>jsotp</em> is available under a BSD-style <A
HREF="license.html">license</A>. The HTML scaffolding on this site also falls
under the same license. As mentioned previously, feel free to mirror whatever
pages you need on your own webspace for better security (and again, note that
the single-hash versions contain all code inline, so you can just save the
page directly).
